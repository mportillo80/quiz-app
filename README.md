# Quiz App

Welcome my quiz app. This is a very simple application that demonstrates basic pseudo-classical inheritance in JavaScript and some light MVC architecture.

## What to Add

* input validation
* score calculation
* improved styling
* question category selection
* dynamic data (API implementation)
* flesh out results view (e.g. percent complete, message describing effort)
* celebratory finish (if results are good enough)
